ndpolator: fast, n-dimensional linear interpolation and extrapolation on sparse grids {#mainpage}
=====================================================================================

Introduction
------------

Ndpolator allows you to interpolate and/or extrapolate function values on an n-dimensional cartesian grid with missing values.

Overall logic
-------------

Ndpolator requires the following structures as input:

* a set of axes that span the n-dimensional grid;
* an n-dimensional matrix of function values on the grid spanned by the axes;
* a set of query points for which we want to determine their function values.

Grid points are given by a cartesian product of axial vertices. For example, axes ``a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`` and ``a2 = [5, 6, 7]`` span a 2-dimensional grid; values ``1, 2, 3, 4`` are *vertices* on ``a1``; values ``5, 6, 7`` are *vertices* on ``a2``. Their cartesian product defines 12 grid points: ``(1, 5)``, ``(1, 6)``, ``(1, 7)``, ``(2, 5)``, ``(2, 6)``, ``(2, 7)``, ``(3, 5)``, ``(3, 6)``, ``(3, 7)``, ``(4, 5)``, ``(4, 6)`` and ``(4, 7)``. If a grid point has a defined function value, it is called a *node*. If a grid point does not have a defined function value, it is called a *void*. A *sparse grid* is a grid that has a combination of nodes and voids. Nodes can hold scalars or arrays of any length; voids hold ``nan``s. The job of the ndpolator is to linearly interpolate and/or extrapolate function values on the sparse grid.

This is done in several steps. For each query point, the interpolator:

1. finds the local n-dimensional hypercube that encloses the query point, and stores the superior corner's indices;
2. transforms the query point into hypercube-normalized coordinates, ``[0, 1] x [0, 1] x ... x [0, 1] = [0, 1]^n``;
3. flags each query point component as on-vertex, on-grid, or out-of-bounds;
4. for any on-vertex components, it reduces hypercube dimensionality;
5. checks to see if the query point is inside of a fully defined hypercube; if so, it proceeds with interpolation;
6. if the query point is not in a fully defined hypercube, it extrapolates from the nearest node or the nearest fully defined hypercube.

Continuing with our example above, say that ``q1 = [2.5, 6.2]`` is the query point; the enclosing 2-dimensional hypercube is ``hc1 = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}`` (these are the boundary indices along ``a1`` and ``a2``). The reference to that hypercube are the indices of the superior corner, ``sc1 = (2, 2)``. The query point is then transformed into the hypercube-normalized coordinates, ``nq1 = [(2.5-2)/(3-2), (6.2-6)/(7-6)] = [0.5, 0.2]``. This achieves equal step sizes along every direction, irrespective of the absolute vertex values. Both components are then flagged as on-grid, and as no components coincide with any vertices, function values are interpolated and returned.

Let us consider another example: let ``q2 = [2.0, 6.5]``. This time the first component coincides with a vertex, and the dimension of the hypercube can be reduced to 1-D: ``hc2 = {(1, 1), (1, 2)}``. The original hypercube-normalized coordinate, ``nq2 = [0, 0.5]``, is then reduced to ``nq2 = [0.5]``. Interpolation then continues as before, this time in 1 dimension instead of 2.

Finally, let us consider a query point off the grid: ``q3 = [0.8, 5.3]``. The corresponding normalized query point is ``nq3 = [-0.2, 0.3]`` and the enclosing hypercube does not exist. There are 3 extrapolation types: no extrapolation, extrapolation to the nearest node, and linear extrapolation. If no extrapolation is requested, a nan is returned. If extrapolation to the nearest node is requested, ndpolator finds the nearest node, in this case ``(0, 0)``, and it assigns its function value to the ndpolant. If linear extrapolation is requested, ndpolator finds the nearest fully defined hypercube, in this case ``(1, 1)``, and linearly extrapolates from that hypercube.
